# eslint-config-relekang

This is pretty personal, but you are free to use it.
Keep it mind, it might change radically without much notice.

Adding new rules is not considered a breaking change for this project since it
is maintained for my personal use.

```
yarn add eslint-config-relekang
./node_modules/.bin/relekang-eslint-config
```
